 How I Built This Website
I built this personal website using basic web technologies to keep it lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain. Here's how I did it:

Planning & Content
I started by outlining the core content I wanted to include:

My name and introduction

A short “About Me” section

A link to my LinkedIn profile

HTML (Structure)
I created a simple index.html file using semantic HTML elements. This file holds the structure of the website, such as headers, paragraphs, and links.

CSS (Styling)
I wrote a separate style.css file to style the page. I used:

A soft background gradient

Rounded containers and subtle shadows

A custom font from Google Fonts (Poppins)

A responsive layout that works on desktops and phones
